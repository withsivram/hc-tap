      # We need to bootstrap the ECR repos first if they don't exist?

      # Chicken and egg.
      # Solution: Run CDK deploy (infrastructure only) -> Push Images -> Update Services?
      # Or simpler: Run CDK deploy first. It will create Repos. It might fail to start Tasks if images missing.
      # That's acceptable for first run.
