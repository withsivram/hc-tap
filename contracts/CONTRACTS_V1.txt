Healthcare Text Analytics Pipeline — Contracts v1.0.0

WHAT THIS IS
We will keep files and API responses consistent so all teammates can work in parallel.

NOTE OBJECT (input)
- note_id (string): unique id, e.g., "note_001"
- specialty (string): medical specialty
- text (string): the note content
- checksum (string): simple fingerprint to avoid duplicates

MAPPING FROM MTSamples CSV
- CSV.medical_specialty  -> note.specialty
- CSV.transcription      -> note.text
- CSV.sample_name        -> (ignored for now)

ENTITY RECORD (output, JSONL; one JSON per line)
- note_id (string)
- run_id (string): e.g., "LOCAL" or a timestamp
- entity_type (string): "PROBLEM" or "MEDICATION"
- text (string): exact text span from the note
- norm_text (string): normalized form (e.g., "metformin 500 mg" -> "metformin")
- begin (int): start character index of the span (0-based)
- end (int): end index (exclusive) = begin + length(text)
- score (number 0..1): confidence score
- section (string): rough area of note if known (e.g., "medications", "assessment")

FOLDERS WE'RE USING LOCALLY
- fixtures/notes/      -> example input notes (JSON)
- fixtures/entities/   -> example extracted entities (JSONL)

ENDPOINTS WE’LL BUILD LATER (READ-only)
- GET /notes/{id}
- GET /search?type=&q=&limit=&cursor=
- GET /stats/run/{id}

PRIVACY
- Use only synthetic or de-identified notes for local work.
- Do not publish real data to public repos.
