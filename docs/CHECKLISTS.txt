Akshay — Ingest/ETL & Extraction
[Status: not started / in progress / done]

Goal this week: write the plain-English plan and list the files you will read/write locally.

[ ] Update docs/ETL_PLAN.txt with:
    - Input files: fixtures/notes/*.json
    - Output files: fixtures/enriched/entities/run=LOCAL/part-*.jsonl (for now we’ll keep them under fixtures/)
    - Idempotency plan: reuse note_id and checksum in filenames
    - Run summary: fixtures/runs_LOCAL.json fields you will populate
[ ] List 3 edge cases you’ll handle later (e.g., empty text, weird Unicode, giant notes)
[ ] Add a tiny “dry-run” checklist in the file (how you’ll test on 2 notes)

Evidence to include in PR:
- docs/ETL_PLAN.txt updated with the above bullets.

Kevin — API & Auth
[Status: not started / in progress / done]

Goal this week: finalize the three READ endpoints in plain English with examples from fixtures.

[ ] Update docs/API_ENDPOINTS_DRAFT.txt with:
    - GET /notes/{id}
      • Returns: note_id, specialty, text_length, entities[]
      • Example note_id: "note_001"
    - GET /search?type=&q=&limit=&cursor=
      • type ∈ {PROBLEM, MEDICATION}, q is substring match on norm_text
      • Example: type=MEDICATION&q=metformin → returns note_001 hit
    - GET /stats/run/{id}
      • Returns fields from fixtures/runs_LOCAL.json
[ ] Add one minimal example response per endpoint using our fixtures (2–6 lines each)

Evidence to include in PR:
- docs/API_ENDPOINTS_DRAFT.txt updated with parameters + tiny examples.

Suryodaya — Analytics & Viz
[Status: not started / in progress / done]

Goal this week: describe the first dashboard screen (what it shows and from which files).

[ ] Update docs/DASHBOARD_KPIS.txt with:
    - KPIs (v1): total notes processed, top 10 Problems, top 10 Medications
    - Data sources (for local): fixtures/enriched/entities/run=LOCAL/*.jsonl and fixtures/runs_LOCAL.json
    - Simple rules: how to count entities (per line = 1); case-insensitive on norm_text
[ ] Add a 5-line wireframe description:
    - Top row: totals (notes, entities)
    - Middle: top 10 Problems
    - Bottom: top 10 Medications
[ ] Note one future filter (by run_id)

Evidence to include in PR:
- docs/DASHBOARD_KPIS.txt updated with data sources + wireframe.

Kunal — Eval/QA & PM
[Status: not started / in progress / done]

Goal this week: tighten labeling rules and outline the mini gold set.

[ ] Update docs/LABELING_GUIDE_DRAFT.txt with:
    - PROBLEM: symptoms/diagnoses (ex: “hypertension”, “chest tightness”)
    - MEDICATION: drug name (norm_text) with dose kept in text (ex: “metformin 500 mg” → norm_text “metformin”)
    - Exclude: section headers, negated mentions (e.g., “no chest pain”), and family history that’s not current problem
    - Matching: exact span for eval; also track a relaxed overlap (later)
[ ] Define the pilot gold set plan:
    - 10 notes (LOCAL), dual-label by 2 people, record disagreements
    - File path for labels (later): gold/labels.jsonl (not created yet)
[ ] Add 3 examples to include and 3 to exclude using our fixtures’ wording

Evidence to include in PR:
- docs/LABELING_GUIDE_DRAFT.txt updated with rules + pilot plan.
