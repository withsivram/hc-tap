# Working Agreements (HC-TAP)

- Small PRs (<300 LoC), 1 reviewer required, merge only when CI is green.
- Respond to review comments within 24 hours.
- Use the PR template; include “Closes #<issue>”.
- No secrets in repo: use `.env` locally, SSM/AWS Secrets later.
- Keep `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` updated with 1–2 bullets when merging to `main`.
