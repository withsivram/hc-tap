PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:, Bilateral inguinal hernias with bilateral hydroceles after right inguinal hernia repair, cerebral palsy, asthma, seizure disorder, developmental delay, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Left inguinal hernia, bilateral hydroceles, and right torsed appendix testis.,PROCEDURE: , Right inguinal exploration, left inguinal hernia repair, bilateral hydrocele repair, and excision of right appendix testis.,FLUIDS RECEIVED: ,700 mL of crystalloid.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ,10 mL.,SPECIMENS:, Tissue sent to pathology is calcified right appendix testis.,TUBES/DRAINS: , No tubes or drains were used.,COUNTS: ,Sponge and needle counts were correct x2.,ANESTHESIA: , General inhalational anesthetic and 0.25% Marcaine ilioinguinal nerve block, 30 mL given per surgeon.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: ,The patient is a 14-1/2-year-old boy with multiple medical problems, primarily due to cerebral palsy, asthma, seizures, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and developmental delay. He had a hernia repair done on the right in the past, but developed a new hernia on the right and a smaller on the left. The plan is for repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in the supine position. IV antibiotics were given. He was then sterilely prepped and draped. A right inguinal incision was made in the previous incisional site with a 15-blade knife, extended down through the subcutaneous tissue and Scarpa fascia with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.,The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised. There was a moderate amount of scar tissue noted, but we were able to incise that and go down into the right inguinal canal.
