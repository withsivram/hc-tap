LOCAL DEMO — read me first (no code)

Goal
See how a note (input) matches its extracted entities (output) using our fixtures.

Files
- fixtures/notes/note_001.json
- fixtures/entities/note_001.jsonl
- fixtures/notes/note_002.json
- fixtures/entities/note_002.jsonl

What to do (takes ~60 seconds)
1) Open fixtures/notes/note_001.json
   - Find "note_id": it should say "note_001".
   - Read the "text" once.

2) Open fixtures/entities/note_001.jsonl
   - There are two lines (two entities).
   - Each line is a complete JSON object.
   - Check "note_id" matches "note_001".
   - Check "entity_type" is either PROBLEM or MEDICATION.
   - Optional: look back at the note text and find the same words as "text" (e.g., "metformin 500 mg").

3) Repeat for note_002 (note + entities).

Quick mental KPIs (manual)
- Notes processed: 2
- Entities found: 4 (2 per note)
- Entity types present: PROBLEM, MEDICATION
