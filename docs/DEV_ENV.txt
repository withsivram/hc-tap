Use Python 3.12.6; run `make bootstrap` once to install deps.

Phase-3 quickstart (rule-based baseline):
  make ingest-50
  make validate
  make etl-local
  make eval
  make dash

To use LLM extraction:
  1. Set EXTRACTOR_LLM=openai (or anthropic) in .env
  2. Set OPENAI_API_KEY (or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) in .env
  3. Run: make etl-llm && make eval && make dash

Gold maintenance:
  - Run `make gold-sync` after changing preprocessing/normalization so stored spans stay aligned.
  - Run `make gold-bootstrap` to draft candidate labels (gold/gold_DRAFT.jsonl) for notes not yet covered; promote manually, then re-run `make gold-sync`.
