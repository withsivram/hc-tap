  "text": "OBSERVATIONS: , The forced vital capacity is 2.84 L and forced expiratory volume in 1 second is 1.93 L. The ratio between the two is 68%. Small improvement is noted in the airflows after bronchodilator therapy. Lung volumes are increased with a residual volume of 196% of predicted and total lung capacity of 142% of predicted. Single-breath diffusing capacity is slightly reduced.,IMPRESSION: , Mild-to-moderate obstructive ventilatory impairment. Some improvement in the airflows after bronchodilator therapy.",
